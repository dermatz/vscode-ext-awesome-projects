## Settings

You can configure the extension using the `settings.json` file in Visual Studio Code. The following parameters are available:

- `awesomeProjects.projects`: An array of project objects. Each project object can have the following properties:
  - `path`: The file path of the project.
  - `name`: The name of the project.
  - `color`: (Optional) A color associated with the project.
  - `productionUrl`: (Optional) The production URL of the project.
  - `devUrl`: (Optional) The development URL of the project.
  - `stagingUrl`: (Optional) The staging URL of the project.
  - `managementUrl`: (Optional) The management URL of the project. Like Jira or other Project-Management Tools.

- `awesomeProjects.useFavicons`: A boolean value to enable or disable the use of favicons for projects. When enabled, the extension will attempt to fetch and display the favicon of the project's URL.

Example configuration:
```json
{
    "awesomeProjects.projects": [
        {
            "path": "/path/to/project1",
